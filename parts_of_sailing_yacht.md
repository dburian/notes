# Parts of sailing yachts

Thesaurus of basic parts of a sailing boat (Czech translation in braces).

## Basics

- hull (trup) -- the main body of the boat which floats
- mast (stěžeň) -- long pole in the center of the boat that carries sails
- boom (ráhno) -- horizontal pole attached to mast pointing backward
- stern (záď) -- the back of the boat
- bow (příď) -- the front of the boat
- rudder (kormidlo) -- vertical fin that at the stern used to control the boat
- keel (kýl) -- vertical fin going from center of the boat that balances the
  boat so that it doesn't tip over
- helm (kormidlo) -- steering wheel that controls the rudder
- cockpit (kokpit) -- area usually at the stern, from where the boat is
  controlled (most of the time)

## On deck

- cleat (vazák) -- small steel constructions bolted to hull to which we can tie
  a rope
- winch (vinšna) -- mechanical spool with which lines can be tighten or loosen

## Sails

Sails are sheets of fabric that when setup correctly, propel the sailboat
forward when wind is blowing.

- mainsail (hlavní plachta) -- the sail between the mast and the boom
- headsail (přední plachta) -- the sail forward of the mast, there are several
  types of headsails:
  - jib (kosatka) -- smaller sail that doesn't reach as far back as the mast is
  - genoa (genoa) -- larger staysail that reaches further back than mast
- batten (vzpíra) -- rigid but flexible sticks helping the sail to keep its
  shape
- telltales () -- small pieces of fabric attached to sails that signal how air
  is flowing around the sail

## Rigging

Rigging is name for all ropes that hold the mast up or control the sails.

### Standing rigging

Lines that support the mast. Usually made from steel.

- backstay (zadní stěh) -- line going from the stern to top of the mast
- forestay (přední stěh) -- line going from the bow to the top of the mast,
  typically is part of leading edge of headsail
- sidestay (levý a pravý vant) -- lines going either left or right from the mast
- spreader (sáling) -- rigid rigging that keeps sidestays in tension and some
  distance from the mast

### Running rigging

Ordinary ropes that control sails.

- boom topping lift (topenanta) -- line going from the end of the boom to top of
  the mast, can lift boom
- halyard (výtah) -- keeps the sail up on the mast, controls sail tightness in
  vertical direction
- sheet (otěž) -- controls sail tightness in horizontal direction
- boom vang/kiking (kiking) -- boom strut that can be tighten to force boom
  downwards
- headsail furler (rolfok) -- spool around headsail that wind headsail up or
  down
