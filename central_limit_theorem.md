# Central limit theorem

In essence, Central Limit Theorem says that the [sampling
distribution](./sampling_distribution.md) of **sample mean** converges to normal
distribution as the sample size grows.

In pratice, when sample size reaches 30, we assume the sample mean will be
normally distributed.

## Why is it useful

Usually we don't know the distribution of anything. Central Limit Theorem says
that, whatever was the underlying distribution, the sampling distribution of
sample mean is normal. Additionally, we know that the mean of the normal is the
true mean of the underlying distribution.


TODO: needs some formal theorem and (maybe) proof, look at my uni notes
