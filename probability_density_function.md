# Probability Density Function

Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that gives us the volume of
probability for given event. For continuous functions $p(x)$ over $x \in
\mathcal{X}$ is a PDF if $p$:

- sums to one $\int_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) dx = 1$
- is positive $p(x) \ge 0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$
