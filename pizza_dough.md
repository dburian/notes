# Neapolitan-style pizza dough

[Original recipe from Joshua Weissman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jOMIdietUQ&t=318s)

## Ingredients

For 3 pizzas:

- 307g of water heated to 35 degrees Celsia
- 2g of instant yeast
- 480g of 00 flour
- 10g of salt
- some olive oil for handling

## Steps

- Mix water and instant east, let rest for 5 mins
- Mix flour and salt, add rested yeasty water and mix just to form a shaggy
  dough
  - Let rest for 20mins at room temperature, **covered**
- Once rested, slap and fold the dough for 2mins just until the dough starts to
  get smooth
- Let it rest for 15mins at room temperature, **covered**
- Repeat slaping and folding the dough until very smooth
- Roll into a taught ball, put in olive-oil greased large bowl and let rest in
  the fridge **covered** for 14-18h
- Once rested, punch air out of the dough and split it into 3 pieces, each
  weighing roughly 250g
- Strech corners of each piece, folding them over to create a *seam*, turn
  each piece on its seam, then form smooth taught balls
- Let the dough balls rest in floured covered container for 3-4 hours

## Log

### 30.6. 2024

I let the dough rest like 19hours, then 3.5 hours outside. During the first
phase the dough risen only moderately, but when left outside (in 30 degrees) the
dough risen and bubbled significantly. Still the pizza wasn't too airy.
