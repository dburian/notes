# Field

In mathematics field is a set with two binary operations called addition ($+$) and
multiplication ($\times$). Additionally these axioms must be met:

1. Both operations are *associative*
2. Both operations are *commutative*
3. Both operations have identities (i.e. $\exists 0: 0 + a = a$)
4. Both operations have inverses (i.e. $\exists b: a + b = 0$)
5. Distributivity holds (i.e. $a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$)
