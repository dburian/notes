# Sampling distribution

To estimate a parameter of a population we take out samples from the population
and compute a statistic, with which we estimate the original parameter. Since
the statistic is dependent on the random sample set, the statistic itself is a
random variable with some distribution. That distribution is called *sampling
distribution* of that statistic.

Often the set of samples is viewed as one sample. The individuals should be
drawn randomly from the population *with replacement* so that they are
independent.
