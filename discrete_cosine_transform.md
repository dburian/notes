# Discrete Cosine Transform

Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a lot like [Discrete Fourier Transform
(DFT)](./discrete_fourier_transform.md) except it expresses the signal with
real-valued cosines, rather than complex-valued exponentials. The result is that
we get real-valued coefficients, which are easier to work with and preferred for
a number of ML applications.
