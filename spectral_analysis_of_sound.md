# Spectral analysis of sound signal

Spectral analysis of sound signal describes how to split up any sound signal to
pure frequencies the sound is made up of. This is done using [Discrete Fourier
transform (DFT)](./discrete_fourier_transform.md).

TODO:
- why we can do it -- what properties are necessary, some intuition for it
- how do we do it
