# Matrix norms

There are many, but the most popular is Forbenious norm.

## General form

For a [field][field] $K$ let's suppose:

- $\lVert \cdot \rVert_\alpha$ be a vector norm on $K^n$
- $\lVert \cdot \rVert_\beta$ be a vector norm on $K^m$


## Forbenious norm

Forbenious norm is a special case of a $L_{p, q}$ norm for $p = q = 2$.

$$
||A||_F = \sqrt{\sum_i \sum_j |a_{i, j}|^2} = \sqrt{trace(A^TA)}
$$
