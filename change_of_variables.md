# Change of variables

Often math equations can be simplified by substituting variable expression for a
single new variable. This substitution is called *change of variables*.

Often times change of variables can be straight forward, but not always. Here
are some cases to watch out for:

- [in differentiation](./change_of_variables_diff.md) -- don't forget the chain
  rule
- [in integrals](./change_of_variables_int.md) -- what would the chain rule do
  here
- [in Probability density functions](./change_of_variables_pdf.md) -- special
  case of substitution inside integrals with extra conditions on the
  substitution function
