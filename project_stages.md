# Project stages

My last project was more complicated and longer than usual. Normally I'd do some
brainstorming, then sketch out the project and just go with it. Since the
projects are normally pretty short (month at most), the deadline was always
right around the corner. Also since the projects weren't that much complicated,
the initial brainstorming was enough to get me (more or less) successfully to
the end of the project.

For longer and more complex project I propose to define checkpoints with
deadlines during the initial planning phase. This ensures:

- quicker realization if I am not delivering what I wanted or falling behind
- quicker feedback loop
- clearer roadmap
