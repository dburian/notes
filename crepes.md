## Log

### 7.7. 2024

- 20g of melted butter
- 10g of neutral oil
- 1 teaspoon of sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla sugar / instead of vanilla extract
- fried on oil not on butter

Two pinches of salt next time. Maybe try melted butter and no oil (frying on oil
is still fine), but there was definitely enough fat.

Heat management was a bit tricky, you need heat for the crepe to set and not
tear when flipping. But not very high heat, since the thin crepe gets easily
burned.
