# Butter tortilla dough

## Ingredients

- 80g butter
- 450g all-purpose flour
- 250g water
- 5g salt

Yields about 14 medium tortillas.

## Steps

1. Mix flour with butter, pinch in the butter until only there are only small
   crumbs of it.

2. Gradually mix in salt disolved in the water to form shaggy dough.

3. Kneed the dough until smooth (~5 mins). Let rest in frige for 20mins.

4. Cut the dough to 75g for burritos, 50g for 28cm pan, 25g for taco-size
   tortilla.

5. Give each side of a tortilla about 10s on a iron skillet on medium flame.


## Log

### 12.6. 100g of butter, thinly rolled out

Turns out butter adds flavour, but nothing magical happened going from 80g to
100g.

Thin tortillas might not be the way to go, I suspect that thicker tortillas
result get more puffed.

### 4.6.

- 80g of fat, 20g of lard (could just do without the lard)

Thicker tortillas are definitely way to go. 9 tortillas total.
