# Focus

## Change of perspective

My idea of focus has always been that it is something gained by investing
energy. That it is something which is achieved, obtained. And that I have to
*try* to be focused. That view changed when I started meditating with [Headspace
on Focus][s/headspace-focus].

Now I realize we focus quite naturally -- it is not something we have to try to
achieve or gain. *We already have it.* We just have to let go of distracting
thoughts, of thoughts we wouldn't like to focus on.

In other words when focusing you should not:
- narrow your view
- try hard or invest a great amount of energy.

Instead **you should**:
- let go,
- relax,
- widen your view,
- in a sense give up the (quite natural) temptation to think.

This clicked for me only after the second run through the course (~2 months).

What helps me to achieve that state is to realize **all thoughts are a
distraction**. Stop thinking about the things you should've done, should be
doing or you must do in the future. Just stop. **Give up.**. Then, suddenly,
everything stops and you have a clear head to focus only on the one, single,
chosen subject.

In this state you are more aware. You focus quite easily, but with grace not
by forcing it. This is how I understand what Headspace calls *'soft focus'*.

## Common pitfalls

### Thinking about thinking

It sometimes happens you let go, but you're unsure if you really let go. So you
think: "Did I really let go of all thoughts?". If it isn't clear already you did
not -- you are thinking about the thoughts currently running through your mind.
And that is still a thought you should let go of. So to all perfectionist: Let
go and trust me -- you feel that you let go without thinking about it.
