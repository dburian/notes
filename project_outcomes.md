# Project outcomes

When well-defined, project outcomes are everything. They are the reason we are
doing the project, they are the result of the project, they are what are we
aiming for... When you realize, you've not been paying attention to them, you
will soon realize you have a big problem.

This happens to me all the time. I start a project in order to achieve something
(=outcomes). Then I get caught-up in some issue and while trying to resolve it,
I start to think that solving the issue is actually the goal of the project.

Always have the **big picture** of what you are doing. Always know the outcomes.
