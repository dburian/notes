# What to write about and how to write it -- my approach

## What

I don't want to write what we can easily find on web: definitions, shallow
descriptions, ... Instead I focus on my take, my intuitive understanding.
Usually a note (or notes) comes from my research whose results I don't want to
forget.

My take on notes is they should accelerate how learning about the subject. The
goal is then to redirect to useful information, give summaries and describe
different views on the subject to what is broadly available.

## How - Minimal cost, maximal payback

The goal of my note taking is to quickly write down the ideas so that there is
minimal cost to writing something down and maximal payback when I need the
information.

The quality of notes will come from iteration -- every time I revisit a note I
could correct it or rephrase it. Making the highly used information coherently
and concisely written, while those notes I've never looked at are just
scribbles.

The idea is to avoid perfectionism and situations, where I invest 4h into a
single note, but never look at it again. The reward of taking notes is not
actually having nicely written notes, but having the information. We just need
to minimize the up-front cost of writing the information down.
