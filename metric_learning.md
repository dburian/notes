# Metric learning

In metric learning we map data samples onto a real-valued vector space. The task
is to do it in a such a way that **the relative positions** of 2 data samples in
the vector space **reflect thier similarity**. This allows to quickly compute
similarity between any two data samples which is handy in retrieval.
