# LLama 2

A open-sourced LLM released by Meta and introduced by [Touvron et al. (Jul
2023)][paper].

The authors react to a fact that:
- there are few open-sourced LLMs "players" due to high computational
  requirements
- the open-sourced variants of closed product-like LLMs are not as fine-tuned to
  align with humans and therefore aren't as helpful
- aligning with humans is very costly and currently not very transparent or
  reproducible
